## HELP:
    //help :
        DM the user help

    //tsinit :
        Creates all necesarry roles

    //ts {voice, text} :
        Takes one argument: voice or text. 
        If you have sufficient permissions, you will get the "Talking Stick". Only you will be able to speak or type (depending on which argument you passed) until you either pass the talking stick, or tell Talking Stick to stop

    //tspass :
         If you have the talking stick, you can pass it to someone else. For example:  //tspass @Silence#8808

    //tsleave {voice, text} :
        Takes one argument: voice or text. 
        If you have sufficient privilages, this will unmute everyone or allow everyone to type (depending on which argument you passed) and return them to their original roles.

    //tsdestroy :
         If you have sufficient privilages, this will delete all roles created by the bot. Warning: any users still muted due to Talking Stick will remain muted until unmuted by a moderator.

    //tsgivecon :
         If you have sufficient privilages, this will allow you to give another user the Stick Controller role.

    //tsremcon :
         If you have sufficient privilages, this will allow you to remove another user from the Stick Controller role.

    //tsaddstick :
         If you have sufficient privilages, this will allow you to give another user in the voice channel a talking stick, while keeping your own.

    //tsremstick :
         If you have sufficient privilages, this will allow you to take a stick from a mentioned user.





IF THE BOT IS TELLING YOU TO MOVE THE "Talking Stick" ROLE OR NOT WORKING 

1:
    In your server, go to server settings.
2:
    Drag the Talking Stick role above all of the Talking Stick created roles (Stick Controller, Stick Holder, Stick Listener, TSLeft).
    (Note: This will not display it as being above all other roles in the member viewer)
